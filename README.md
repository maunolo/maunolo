# Maunolo (Mauricio Nogueira Lopes)

I am a software developer with experience in a variety of programming languages, currently focused on Ruby for Back-end development and React with TypeScript for Front-end. I am also currently studying Rust and looking forward to incorporating it into my skill set, in fact I started a side project in rust for learning purposes, it's a chessboard website using two rust libraries [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos) for the Front-end and [Actix Web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web) for the Back-end, you can check out the code at [github.com/maunolo/chess_web](https://github.com/maunolo/chess_web) and access the website at [chess.maunolo.dev](https://chess.maunolo.dev)

You can check [maunolo.dev](https://maunolo.dev) to see a summary of my skills and the companies I have worked for. Additionally, my [Github](https://github.com/maunolo) repositories also provide examples of my work.
